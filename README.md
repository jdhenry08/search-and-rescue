# Search & Rescue

This is a React project written for Fetch's [frontend take-home exercise](https://frontend-take-home.fetch.com).

## Running locally

There aren't any required environment variables, so you should just be able to install dependencies and run with the package manager of your choice (by default, this will host on port 3000):

### npm
> ```bash
> you@your-pc:~$ npm install
> you@your-pc:~$ npm run dev
> ```

### yarn
> ```bash
> you@your-pc:~$ yarn install
> you@your-pc:~$ yarn dev
> ```

### pnpm
> ```bash
> you@your-pc:~$ pnpm install
> you@your-pc:~$ pnpm dev
> ```
